# Scoreservice

The scoreservice serves the arcade functionality of hobbyfarm.
It simply stores arcade scores inside a cache and can can retreive a list of them as a leaderboard.

## Using scoreservice for standalone arcade

It is possible to use the scoreservice without hobbyfarm to serve bashbrawl on an arcade or via the bashbrawl website.
For conferences it is also possible persons to get their badge scanned and play the arcade. After scanning their badge they are on cooldown from playing the arcade for a specified time, so that other people can also enjoy the arcade.
