// Event is an object that holds information and object references for something that happened (an event).
// An Event is what is used to communicate information about the processing of objects by HobbyFarm
// and/or other controllers. For example, provisioning steps about Machine resources may be communicated
// via multiple Event objects.
//
// Event objects are only expected to exist in primary storage for the duration of the referenced object's
// lifecycle, plus a little extra. After that they may be garbage collected and moved to longer term storage
// if such storage is available. This is necessary because large deployments necessitate many events being
// created and bogging down primary storage is not good.

	// EventTime is overridden via wrangler tag to type=string because wrangler is not aware
	// of metav1.MicroTime and attempts to create a CRD in which that is represented as an object

	// of a controller running.
